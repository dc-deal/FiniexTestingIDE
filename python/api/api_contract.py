"""
The API's CONTRACT version — what a consumer builds against, and what they can assert.

The app version moves on every release; the contract moves when a route or a response model
moves, and the two are not the same clock. Measured 2026-09-22: three models changed shape
inside one app version — `reconciles` became three-state, `run_net_pnl` became nullable,
`segment_trade_count` was removed — and a consumer had no way to see any of it. `/health`
reported the same number before and after.

**Deliberately not a deprecation mechanism.** A deprecation warning promises that the old shape
still works for a while; §27 says this project ships no backward-compatibility layers in the
alpha, so such a promise would be one we never keep. What is offered instead is stronger
because it is true: the server states which contract it IS, a consumer records that number
with its fixtures and asserts it at start-up. A stale mock then fails loudly and locally — no
connection needed, because the number travels IN the response it was captured from.

Bumped BY HAND, in the same change that moves a model. `CHANGES` carries what moved in the
current version, for the consumer deciding whether they care; the full history is
`docs/consumer/contract-log.md`, which the API serves at GET /api/v1/docs/contract-log.
