FiniexTestingIDE - Worker Coordinator (REFACTORED)
Coordinates multiple workers and delegates decision-making to DecisionLogic

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (Issue 2):
- Workers are now injected (created by Factory)
- DecisionLogic is now injected (no hardcoded strategy)
- Coordinator only coordinates, doesn't decide

Philosophy:
- Workers are atomic units (compute indicators)
- DecisionLogic orchestrates results (makes trading decisions)
- Coordinator manages the tick-by-tick flow
