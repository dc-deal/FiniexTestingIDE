# FiniexTestingIDE - Logs Directory
# Ignore all generated log files and run directories

# Ignore everything in this directory
*

# Except this .gitignore file
!.gitignore

# This ensures that:
# - All run directories (timestamp-based) are ignored
# - All log files (global.log, scenario_*.log) are ignored
# - All config snapshots (config.json) are ignored
# - The directory structure remains in git, but content is ignored
